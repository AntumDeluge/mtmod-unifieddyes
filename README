This is a pretty extensive dyes mod, which has the sole purpose of 
supplying a complete set of colors and a few greys, all of which are 
intended to be used by other mods as needed to make colored objects.  It 
uses Ironzorg's Flowers mod as the source of the actual pigments.  
Flowers can be had from one of the links below, or as part of neko259's 
Nature Pack.

In total, this mod provides [b]77[/b] colors (including greys) at present.
